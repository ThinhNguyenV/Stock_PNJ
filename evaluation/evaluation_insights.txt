## Key Findings

1. The Linear Regression model significantly outperforms all other models with the lowest RMSE (1.28) and highest R² (0.96).
2. The tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) perform similarly to each other but not as well as Linear Regression.
3. The ARIMA model performs poorly with a negative R² value, indicating it performs worse than a simple mean-based prediction.
4. The Linear Regression model's errors are relatively small and normally distributed around zero, suggesting unbiased predictions.
5. The mean percentage error for the Linear Regression model is relatively low, indicating good prediction accuracy.

## Recommendations

1. Use the Linear Regression model for making predictions of PNJ stock prices.
2. Consider ensemble methods that combine Linear Regression with other models to potentially improve performance further.
3. For future work, explore deep learning models like LSTM which may capture more complex patterns in the time series data.
4. Regularly retrain the model with new data to maintain prediction accuracy as market conditions change.
5. Consider incorporating external factors like market indices, economic indicators, or news sentiment for potentially improved predictions.
